Coxpcall
http://coxpcall.luaforge.net/

Coxpcall encapsulates the protected calls with a coroutine based loop,
so errors can be dealed without the usual pcall/xpcall issues with coroutines.

Using Coxpcall usually consists in simply loading the module and then replacing Lua
pcall and xpcall by copcall and coxpcall.

Coxpcall is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.

Coxpcall can be downloaded from its LuaForge page. You can also get Coxpcall using LuaRocks:
luarocks install coxpcall
